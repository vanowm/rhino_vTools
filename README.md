## Requirements

- Rhino 8 (for RhinoCommon.dll)
- .NET SDK 7.0+
- Windows

## Build

From this folder:

```powershell
dotnet build .\vTools.csproj -c Release
```

Build behavior:

1. Release builds fail fast if output files are locked (for example, if Rhino holds `vTools.dll`).
2. After every successful Release build, a timestamped backup snapshot is created automatically.

Compile command:

1. Standard Release build:

```powershell
dotnet build d:/github/rhino/vTools/vTools.csproj -c Release
```

## Output

Release output is written to:

- bin/Release/net7.0-windows/vTools.dll
- bin/Release/net7.0-windows/vTools.config.json
- Automatic backups: bin/Release/backups/YY.MM.DD.HHMMSS/

## Rhino usage

All command options persist by default unless stated otherwise.

1. Load the plug-in assembly in Rhino.
1. Run one of the native commands.

### vCurveToSpline flow

1. Select source curves (preselect or postselect is supported).
1. Set `Join` option.

    - `None`: one spline per selected curve.
    - `Connected`: one spline per connected curve island.
    - `All`: one spline through all selected curves.

1. Confirm to create interpolated curve output and select results.

### vFitBox flow

1. Select objects to fit.
1. Adjust options in command line.

    - `AngleStep`: sampling step in degrees and accepts direct numeric input during object picking.
    - `Rotate`: applies final rotation to both fit box and selected objects, keeps the longest in-plane side horizontal, and prefers the equivalent orientation that avoids unnecessary 180-degree flips.
    - `Fit`: optimize by `Height` or `Area`.

1. Confirm selection to generate the fit result.

### vLine flow

1. Run `vLine`.
1. Pick the start point.
1. Start-point options:

    - `Mode`: chain behavior for subsequent segments.
      - `Single`: create one segment and finish.
      - `Multiple`: after each segment, pick a fresh start point.
      - `Chained`: each next segment starts at the previous end point.
      - `Polyline`: build/update one polyline as you add vertices.
    - `BothSides`: creates a symmetric line centered on the picked start point.
    - `Normal`, `Angled`, `Vertical`, `FourPoint`, `Bisector`, `Perpendicular`, `Tangent`, `BiTangent`, `Extension`: delegates to Rhino native line variants.

1. Pick the end point.
1. End-point options:

    - `Perp`: solve endpoint perpendicular to the hovered curve under cursor.
    - `Tangent`: solve endpoint tangent to the hovered curve under cursor.
    - `PerpNear`: solve perpendicular against nearest curve.
    - `TanNear`: solve tangent against nearest curve.
    - `Auto`: choose perpendicular/tangent solution using `Priority`.
    - `Priority`: auto-mode choice policy.
      - `Closest`: whichever solution is closer to cursor.
      - `PerpFirst`: prefer perpendicular when available.
      - `TanFirst`: prefer tangent when available.
      - `KeepCurrent`: keep previous auto choice when possible.
    - `PersistConstraint`: keeps current constraint mode (`Perp`/`Tangent`/etc.) for following segments.
    - `Length`: forces segment length from start point.
    - `AngleLock`: locks direction by angle.
    - `Angle`: angle value used by `AngleLock`.
    - `AngleRef`: `Absolute` uses CPlane X-axis; `Relative` uses previous segment direction.
    - `Mode` and `BothSides`: also available while placing the end point.

Hidden keywords while picking:

- `u` or `undo`: undo last in-session segment action.
- `r` or `redo`: redo last undone in-session segment action.

    - `Label`: text used when naming generated output.
    - `Tail`: tail distance used when building end curves.

1. Pick placement point for generated groups, or cancel placement to remove generated objects.

## Configuration

Commands read and write vTools.config.json next to the plug-in assembly. Sections are created per command as options are used.

Example:

```json
{
  "vUzip": {
    "label": "",
    "tail": 0.75,
    "layers": {
      "reference": { "name": "Reference", "color": "#FFFFFF" },
      "plot": { "name": "PLOT", "color": "#0F8A8A" },
      "cut": { "name": "CUT1", "color": "#CC3333" }
    },
    "parts": []
  }
}
```

## Logging

- Plug-in startup log: logs/vTools.log

The code resolves a project-local logs folder first and falls back to an assembly-local logs folder.
