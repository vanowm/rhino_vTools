## Requirements

- Rhino 8 (for RhinoCommon.dll)
- .NET SDK 7.0+
- Windows

## Build

From this folder:

```powershell
dotnet build .\vTools.csproj -c Release
```

Build behavior:

1. Release builds fail fast if output files are locked (for example, if Rhino holds `vTools.dll`).
2. After every successful Release build, a timestamped backup snapshot is created automatically.

Compile command:

1. Standard Release build:

```powershell
dotnet build d:/github/rhino/vTools/vTools.csproj -c Release
```

## Output

Release output is written to:

- bin/Release/net7.0-windows/vTools.dll
- bin/Release/net7.0-windows/vTools.config.json
- Automatic backups: bin/Release/backups/YY.MM.DD.HHMMSS/

## Rhino usage

All command options persist by default unless stated otherwise.

1. Load the plug-in assembly in Rhino.
1. Run one of the native commands.

### vCurveToSpline flow

1. Select source curves (preselect or postselect is supported).
1. Set `Join` option.

    - `None`: one spline per selected curve.
    - `Connected`: one spline per connected curve island.
    - `All`: one spline through all selected curves.

1. Confirm to create interpolated curve output and select results.

### vFitBox flow

1. Select objects to fit.
1. Adjust options in command line.

    - `AngleStep`: sampling step in degrees and accepts direct numeric input during object picking.
    - `Rotate`: applies final rotation to both fit box and selected objects, keeps the longest in-plane side horizontal, and prefers the equivalent orientation that avoids unnecessary 180-degree flips.
    - `Fit`: optimize by `Height` or `Area`.

1. Confirm selection to generate the fit result.

### vLine flow

1. Run `vLine`.
1. Pick the start point.
1. Start-point options:

    - `Mode`: chain behavior for subsequent segments.
      - `Single`: create one segment and finish.
      - `Multiple`: after each segment, pick a fresh start point.
      - `Chained`: each next segment starts at the previous end point.
      - `Polyline`: build/update one polyline as you add vertices.
    - `BothSides`: creates a symmetric line centered on the picked start point.
    - `Normal`, `Angled`, `Vertical`, `FourPoint`, `Bisector`, `Perpendicular`, `Tangent`, `BiTangent`, `Extension`: delegates to Rhino native line variants.

1. Pick the end point.

    - `PersistConstraint`: keeps current constraint mode (`Perp`/`Tangent`/etc.) for following segments.
    - `Length`: forces segment length from start point.
    - `AngleLock`: locks direction by angle.
    - `Angle`: angle value used by `AngleLock`.
    - `AngleRef`: `Absolute` uses CPlane X-axis; `Relative` uses previous segment direction.
    - `Mode` and `BothSides`: also available while placing the end point.

### vLineLength flow

1. Run `vLineLength`.
1. Click an open curve near the end you want to drive.
1. Use options while editing:

    - `Length`: target value used by current mode.
    - `ExtendMode`: extension style when target requires growth.
      - `Smooth`: smooth extension.
      - `Line`: straight-line extension.

1. The command aligns curve directions and seams automatically, then creates an interpolated curve equidistant between the two inputs.
1. Sample density is chosen adaptively and refined until the middle curve error is within tolerance.

### vOffset flow

1. Run `vOffset`.
1. The built-in `_Offset` command runs interactively.
1. After each offset, selection is cleared automatically.
1. Press Enter to repeat `vOffset` for another offset cycle.

1. Otherwise, set width: select curves to use their total length, type a number, or press Enter to keep the current value.
1. Set height the same way.
1. Pick the bottom-left corner. Press Enter to reuse the previous bottom-right position.
1. Live preview shows the rectangle while moving the cursor.
1. Use `Width` and `Height` options while picking the corner to adjust values.

### vScallop flow

1. Run `vScallop`.
1. Select a line, or press Enter to pick two points.
1. Pick side point to define bulge direction.
1. Use options:

    - `Size`: scallop bulge distance.
    - `Free`: when `Yes`, bulge is measured from midpoint to picked side point; when `No`, uses fixed `Size`.
    - `DeleteOriginal`: when selecting an existing line input, remove that original line after creating the scallop arc.

### vSplitAtCorners flow

    - `Text`: sets content for newly created text and active text edits.
    - `Height`: text height.
    - `Offset`: signed side offset from curve toward text bounds.
    - `Rotate`: rotates text orientation by 90 degrees each use.

### vTextFlip flow

1. Run `vTextFlip`.

1. Use command options:

    - `Flip`: flips selected text orientation using object-local plane behavior.
    - `Rotate`: rotates selected text by 90 degrees.
    - `Clear`: clears current command selection list.

### vTogglePerpGumball flow

1. Run `vTogglePerpGumball` to toggle monitor state (`ON`/`OFF`).

1. The command auto-orients gumball so it stays perpendicular and view-stable without changing the viewport CPlane.
1. `Perspective` viewports keep default gumball, including when switched to `Parallel` projection.
1. When turning `OFF`, gumball orientation is reset to Rhino default.

    - `Join`: `Yes` or `No` for joining kept trim pieces.

1. Preview highlights:

    - Trim removal preview: red.
    - Extend addition preview: green.

### vUzip flow

1. Select the center curve.
1. Adjust runtime options in the command prompt.

    - `Label`: text used when naming generated output.
    - `Tail`: tail distance used when building end curves.

1. Pick placement point for generated groups, or cancel placement to remove generated objects.

## Configuration

Commands read and write vTools.config.json next to the plug-in assembly. Sections are created per command as options are used.

Example:

```json
{
  "vUzip": {
    "label": "",
    "tail": 0.75,
    "layers": {
      "reference": { "name": "Reference", "color": "#FFFFFF" },
      "plot": { "name": "PLOT", "color": "#0F8A8A" },
      "cut": { "name": "CUT1", "color": "#CC3333" }
    },
    "parts": []
  }
}
```

## Logging

- Plug-in startup log: logs/vTools.log

The code resolves a project-local logs folder first and falls back to an assembly-local logs folder.
